# EDA-Modelling-Hearts_ds

This consists of minor EDA on the hearts dataset and then trying multiple models :
1. SVM
2. Tensorflow neural network with 1 hidden layer
3. Logistic Regression

What i found is, what we have been taught, practically that complex models work much worse on small datasets for example this dataset has 300 examples which causes it to not much work as well as one would hope on a neural network while it gives around 85% accuracy.
